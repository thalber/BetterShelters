# BetterShelters
RW room pack. Goal: make shelters not boring, and not boxes. Replaces all vanila shelters with new shiny ones. Enjoy.

## HOW TO INSTALL

1) Unpack teh archive
2) Place BetterShelters folder from the archive into [ path-to-your-game ]/Mods/CustomResources
3) Place all **.dll** files from Mods from the archive into [ path-to-your-game ]/Mods/ if you are using Partiality Launcher or [ path-to-your-game ]/BepInEx/plugins if you are using BepInEx; enable all if needed. Using AutoUpdate is not mandatory but strongly advised.
4) Run the game. To see if everything is installed correctly, open mod config menu (from vanilla options screen, button on the bottom left), navigate to CustomRegions config and see if BetterShelters region pack is outlined in green. If it's not, you messed something up.

Installing this region pack the "classic" way by merging folders is very likely to result in a crash. ***Don't do that.***

## HOW TO UNINSTALL
Follow normal uninstallation procedures for all partiality mods/region packs.

PLEASE NOTE: INSTALLING OR UNINSTALLING BETTERSHELTERS WILL CORRUPT YOUR SAVEFILE, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER REGION PACK. MAKE SURE TO RESET THE SAVEFILE AFTER TURNING IT ON OR OFF.
