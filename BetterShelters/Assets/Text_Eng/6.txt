Quite weathered out, but contents are still intelligible.

Inside, there's a picture of a plant, gently held by three different appendages. First looks like a standard issue hand of one of our "parents",<LINE>another is a mechanical protrusion, hydraulics driven. The third... It's organic, but I don't think I recognize its form.

Although, it does remind me of one thing. It's a little bit like a scavenger hand...<LINE>A hand of a scavenger that uses hammers and welding kits more often than spears, perhaps? What a silly thought.

The plant is also unknown to me. It has a long thorned stem, and a bright white flower on the top.<LINE>Seems much softer than any present day flora.

Oh, look, there's a comment as well.
