Oh, this is not a data pearl at all.

The surface is a thin layer of translucent reddish polymer. Quite durable, there is only a few scratches. This layer is monolithic.

Below it, there is a metal sphere with multiple small holes.<LINE>Hemispheres are separate, looks like I could screw it open if it wasn't embedded in the plastic shell.

I can't quite see what's inside the metal ball, my sensory module isn't as good as it used to be.

But it appears to be moving slowly, and emits a very weak neural transmission when I focus on it to analyze.
